Tasks being worked on:

As of Dec 19, 2022
1. Getting the growth curves of the tree species of the researched area (spanning over US & Canadian territories)
  b. Google Scholar scholar.google.ca, Semantic Scholar semanticscholar.org, ISI web of Science
    - AGB increment forest
    - stand growth curve forest
    - stand dynamics forest
    - merchantable volume forest
    - biomass dynamics forest
    - temperate, boreal, etc.
  c. Parameters
    - Above ground biomass (ABG; often in tonnes per hectare)
    - Above ground biomass to below ground biomass ratio (AGB:BGB)
    - Forest condition (e.g. primary or secondary forest)
2. Read "Model of carbon-dynamics in forestry and land-use change"
3. Fixing the CRS of continent shapes
4. Biomass, GSV, tree landscape datasets
5. Interacting with the processed outputs of GCBM.Belize
6. Figuring out Taswira
7. Functions, loops...
