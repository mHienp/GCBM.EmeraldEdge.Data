# Data preprocessing for GCBM.EmeraldEdge
>The Emerald Edge is one of the most productive carbon sinks on Earth, spanning 100 million acres of forest along the Pacific Coast of Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. Benefitting from long-established relationships with Indigenous First Nations, Alaska Natives and coastal tribes are leading sustainable economic and community development. Through the work of Indigenous partners in the area and leveraging local government support, the project will help to sequester 3.5 million metric tons of CO2 through permanent protection of over 100,000 hectares of old growth forest.
