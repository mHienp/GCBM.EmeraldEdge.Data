# Data preprocessing for GCBM.EmeraldEdge
>The Emerald Edge is one of the most productive carbon sinks on Earth, spanning 100 million acres of forest along the Pacific Coast of **Washington**, **British Columbia**, and **Alaska**. Benefitting from long-established relationships with Indigenous First Nations, Alaska Natives and coastal tribes are leading sustainable economic and community development. Through the work of Indigenous partners in the area and leveraging local government support, the project will help to sequester 3.5 million metric tons of CO2 through permanent protection of over 100,000 hectares of old growth forest.

**Coastal Alaska forests not including Cook Inlet**
> **Western hemlock** forests are a major component of forest structure and function throughout the inventory unit. In total, western hemlock forest types contain nearly twice the amount of aboveground biomass (~560 million tons) than any other forest type. When scaled across the landscape, western hemlock, **Sitka spruce** and **western redcedar** contribute nearly equally to the carbon mass of coastal Alaska forests. These species are considered **old-growth** and play an important role in the long-term storage of carbon in the ecosystem.

Cook Inlet has a negligible amount of the major species above so the whole data for them from Coastal Alaska forests can be used for Emerald Edge.

**Western Washington area**
> **Douglas-fir** is the most abundant tree species in Washington and therefore contributes the most to biomass and carbon storage across the state. **Western hemlock**, **western redcedar**, and **Sitka spruce** are found almost exclusively in temperate rainforest on the west side of the state. Hemlock/Sitka spruce forests contain the most biomass and carbon on a per-acre basis.
